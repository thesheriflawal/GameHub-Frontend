# 🎮 Blockchain Paper Games

A collection of fully decentralized, multiplayer classic paper games built on the **Lisk Sepolia network** using Solidity smart contracts and a React frontend.

This project reimagines traditional pen-and-paper games as on-chain experiences, with secure game logic, real-time blockchain state updates, and decentralized player interaction.
